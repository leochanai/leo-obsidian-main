### If you have multiple interests, do not waste the next 2-3 years / 如果你有多种兴趣，不要浪费接下来的 2-3 年

Society made you think that having multiple interests was a weakness.

社会让你认为拥有多种兴趣是一种弱点。

---

Go to school.

去上学。

---

Get a degree.

拿到学位。

---

Get a job.

找一份工作。

---

Retire at some point.

在某个时候退休。

---

But there is so much wrong with that sequence of events.

但这一系列事件中存在着太多错误。

---

We don’t live in the Industrial Age anymore. Specializing in one skill is almost certain death. I feel like we all know by this point how dangerous mechanical living and siloed learning is for your psyche and soul. And people can feel that we’re going through a second renaissance. Your curiosity and love for learning are your advantages in today’s world, but there is something missing.

我们不再生活在工业时代了。只专注于一项技能几乎注定是死路一条。我觉得到目前为止，我们都知道机械化的生活和孤立的学习对你的心理和灵魂有多么危险。人们可以感觉到我们正在经历第二次文艺复兴。在这个世界上，你的好奇心和对学习的热爱是你的优势，但还缺少了一些东西。

---

For the longest time, I learned and learned and learned. I was stuck in tutorial hell. Some may call it shiny object syndrome to point out your lack of focus. I got my dopamine from feeling smart, but my life didn’t change all that much. Honestly, I felt like I was just falling behind. I tried so many different things in college. I had dreams of doing my own thing... earning an income from something creative... but after spending 5 years “learning,” I was met with the reality that I had to get the best job I could find just so I could survive.

很长一段时间里，我一直在不停地学习。我陷入了“教程地狱”。有些人可能会称其为“闪亮事物综合症”，以此来暗示你缺乏专注。我通过感觉自己很聪明来获得多巴胺，但我的生活并没有发生太大的改变。老实说，我觉得自己落后了。我在大学里尝试了许多不同的事情。我梦想着做自己的事业……从创意工作中获得收入……但在花了 5 年时间“学习”之后，我面临的现实是，我必须找到一份我能找到的最好的工作，仅仅是为了生存。

---

The missing piece was a vessel.

缺失的那一块是一个载体。

---

A vessel that would allow me to channel all of my interests into meaningful work that I could earn a decent income from.

一个能够让我将所有兴趣转化为有意义的工作，并从中获得可观收入的载体。

---

If you’ve ever felt guilty for not being able to pick one thing, if you’ve been told to niche down when your mind wants to expand, if you’ve wondered whether there’s a path you can take that doesn’t lead to the misery you see in everyone else’s eyes – this is the greatest time to be alive.

如果你曾因为无法选择一件事情而感到愧疚，如果你曾被告知在思维渴望扩张时要缩减定位，如果你曾怀疑是否存在一条路，不会通向你在其他人眼中看到的痛苦——那么现在就是活着的最好时代。

---

Here are 7 of the most compelling ideas I could come up with. We’ll start by understanding why having multiple interests is a superpower in today's world, then I’ll give you practical steps to turn that into your life’s work. We have a lot to talk about, so I hope you’re here for the ride.

这里是我能想出的 7 个最引人入胜的想法。我们将首先了解为什么在当今世界，拥有多种兴趣是一项超级大国属性，然后我将为你提供将这种优势转化为你终身事业的实际步骤。我们有很多话要谈，所以我希望你能参与进来。

I – The 3 ingredients of individual success & the death of the expert / I – 个人成功的 3 个要素与专家的消亡

> The man whose whole life is spent in performing a few simple operations... generally becomes as stupid and ignorant as it is possible for a human creature to become. — Adam Smith

> “一个人如果一生都在执行几个简单的操作……通常会变得像人类可能变得的那样愚蠢和无知。” —— 亚当·斯密

---

Funny you say that Mr. Smith, because you created those people, and we’re still dealing with the backlash.

斯密先生，你说这话真有意思，因为正是你创造了那些人，而我们现在仍在应对这种后果。

---

Specialization took over during industrialization because, in a pin factory, for example, one worker doing every step could make 20 pins a day. Then workers, each doing one step, could make 48,000.

在工业化过程中，专业化占据了主导地位。例如，在一家针厂，如果一名工人完成所有步骤，每天只能制造 20 根针。而分工明确、每人只负责一个步骤的工人们，每天可以制造 48,000 根。

---

So we built an entire world around this model.

于是，我们围绕这个模式构建了整个世界。

---

Humans became assembly lines working 9 to 5 because frankly, governments don’t serve the national interest, they serve their own interest. Corporations don’t serve the employees interest, they serve their own.

人类变成了从早九点到晚五点工作的流水线，因为坦白说，政府不服务于国家利益，他们服务于自己的利益。公司也不服务于雇员的利益，他们服务于自己的利益。

---

Schools were designed to serve that interest. Their sole purpose was to create factory workers who were punctual and obedient.

***学校的设计就是为了服务于这种利益。它们的唯一目的是培养守时、听话的工厂工人。***

---

But this is no way to live.

但这绝不是生活的方式。

---

If you want to have specialized knowledge so that you could never run an operation, especially your own operation, then be dependent on schools for your education and jobs for your wage. Be duped into believing the promise that specialization is what makes a human valuable when it is clear that the system does not need you, specifically, to perform that task.

如果你想要拥有专门的知识，以至于你永远无法运营一个项目，尤其是你自己的项目，那么就依赖学校提供的教育和工作提供的薪水吧。被那些谎言蒙蔽，相信“专业化才是使人变得有价值的东西”，而现实显然是，这个系统并不依赖“特定的你”来执行那项任务。

---

In lies the distinction.

区别就在这里。

---

If pure specialization makes people stupid and dependent, what makes an individual smart and sovereign?

如果纯粹的专业化使人变得愚蠢且具有依赖性，那么是什么让一个人变得聪明和独立自主？

---

Three ingredients: Self-education, self-interest, self-sufficiency.

三个要素：自我教育、自身利益、自给自足。

---

Self-education is clear, because if you want to achieve a result different from that of traditional education, you must direct your own learning.

自我教育是显而易见的，因为如果你想取得不同于传统教育的结果，你必须引导自己的学习。

---

Self-interest raises some flags. It sounds selfish and short-sighted, which many people view as bad without thinking through it, but it simply means “concern with one’s own interest,” because the only other option is to serve the interest of the organizations that compose society as it is, which we’ve discussed. In other words, follow your interest, because your interest can very well benefit others in a selfless way - depending on your level of cognitive and moral development. Oh, and by the way, indulging in short-lived pleasures (cheap dopamine) is usually not your interest, but the interest of corporations that benefit from your mindlessness.

“自身利益”会引起一些警觉。它听起来自私且短视，许多人不假思索地认为这是坏事，但它仅仅意味着“关注自己的利益”。因为唯一的另一种选择是服务于构成现有社会的组织的利益，这一点我们已经讨论过了。换句话说，追求你的兴趣，因为你的兴趣很可能以一种无私的方式惠及他人——这取决于你的认知和道德发展水平。顺便说一句，沉溺于短暂的快乐（廉价的多巴胺）通常不是你的利益所在，而是那些从你的无意识中获利的公司的利益所在。

---

> The truly selfish person, in Ayn Rand’s view, is a self-respecting, self-supporting human being who neither sacrifices others to himself nor sacrifices himself to others. This rejects both the predator and the doormat.

> “在安·兰德看来，真正自私的人是一个自尊自立的人，他既不为了自己牺牲他人，也不为了他人牺牲自己。这既拒绝了捕食者，也拒绝了受气包。”

---

Self-sufficiency is the refusal to outsource your judgment, learning, and agency. If self-education is the engine and self-interest is the compass, self-sufficiency is the foundation that prevents your life direction from being hijacked by another force. They collaborate, but are not fully dependent.

自给自足是拒绝将你的判断、学习和代理权外包。如果自我教育是引擎，自身利益是指南针，那么自给自足就是防止你的生活方向被另一种力量劫持的基础。它们协同工作，但并非完全依赖。

---

The generalist emerges naturally from this triad.

通才自然而然地从这一三元组中产生。

---

Self-interest motivates self-education.

自身利益激发了自我教育。

---

You learn because it genuinely serves your flourishing, not because someone assigned it.

你学习是因为它真正有助于你的繁荣，而不是因为有人指派了它。

---

Self-education enables self-sufficiency.

自我教育使自给自足成为可能。

---

You can only be sovereign over domains you understand.

你只能在你理解的领域内保持主权。

---

Self-sufficiency clarifies self-interest.

自给自足使自身利益更加明确。

---

When you’re not dependent on others’ interpretations, you can actually perceive what serves you. Most people pursue multiple interests as an escape from their work. When your interests become your work, or your life’s work, most of them start to filter out.

当你不再依赖他人的解释时，你才能真正感知到什么对你有用。大多数人追求多种兴趣是为了逃避工作。当你的兴趣变成你的工作，或者你毕生的事业时，其中大部分会开始被筛选掉。

---

When we look at every CEO, founder, or creative that we actually admire, they are generalists.

当我们审视每一位我们真正敬佩的 CEO、创始人或创意人时，他们都是通才。

---

They understand enough about marketing to direct it, enough about product to build it, and enough about people to lead them. But they also need to direct the ship. They need to learn and adapt when circumstances change.

他们对营销有足够的了解，足以领导它；对产品有足够的了解，足以构建它；对人有足够的了解，足以领导他们。但他们也需要掌舵。当情况发生变化时，他们需要学习并适应。

---

More importantly, they understand that ideas across domains complement each other and create a unique way of viewing the world, which allows them to catch novel ideas from the aether and translate them into market value.

更重要的是，他们明白跨领域的想法是相辅相成的，并创造出一种独特的审视世界的方式，这让他们能够从虚无中捕捉到新颖的想法，并将其转化为市场价值。

---

When we look at where the world is today, and if you understand the opportunities available to singular individuals, not just leaders, you will find that the options you have as a natural polymath are extensive. It should spark an immense amount of excitement in you.

当我们审视当今世界现状时，如果你理解了个人（而不仅是领导者）所拥有的机会，你会发现作为天生的多面手，你拥有的选择非常广泛。这应该会激发你巨大的兴奋感。

---

II – You are living through the second renaissance, take advantage of it / II – 你正生活在第二次文艺复兴中，请利用好它

> Study the science of art. Study the art of science. Develop your senses—especially learn how to see. Realize that everything connects to everything else. — Leonardo da Vinci

> “研究艺术的科学。研究科学的艺术。发展你的感官——尤其是学会如何去观察。意识到万事万物都与其它事物相连。” —— 达·芬奇

---

The ultimate moat, or the final competitive edge worth paying for, in my opinion, is an opinion.

在我看来，最终的护城河，或者说最后值得付费的竞争优势，是一个观点。

---

A perspective that only you can see, because the uniqueness of your life experience created it. That may just be the last thing anyone else can replicate.

一个只有你能看到的视角，因为它是你独特的生活经历所创造的。这可能是别人最后能复制的东西了。

---

And since that’s always been the case, why not prioritize that now? Especially when automation is at our doorstep?

既然一直如此，为什么现在不优先考虑这一点呢？尤其是在自动化即将敲门的时候？

---

But how do you prioritize it? How do you develop it?

但你如何优先考虑它？你又如何发展它？

---

By pursuing multiple interests and building something with them.

通过追求多种兴趣并以此构建一些东西。

---

You see, every interest you’ve ever pursued leaves behind a residue. Every interest increases the number of connections that can be made. Every interest expands and increases the complexity of how you model and interpret reality. The more complex your model of reality, the more problems you can solve, opportunities you can see, and value you can create. Specialism completely halts this process, and your shiny object syndrome has been trying to tell you this whole time.

你看，你追求过的每一个兴趣都会留下残余。每一个兴趣都会增加可以建立的联系数量。每一个兴趣都会扩展并增加你建模和解释现实的复杂性。你的现实模型越复杂，你能解决的问题就越多，能看到的机遇就越多，能创造的价值也就越大。专业化完全阻止了这个过程，而你的“闪亮事物综合症”一直以来都在试图告诉你这一点。

---

From birth until now, you are cultivating a way of seeing things that others can’t. A way of seeing things that AI can only think if you tell it what to think.

从出生到现在，你一直在培养一种别人看不到的看问题的方式。一种只有当你告诉 AI 该想什么时，AI 才能思考的方式。

---

A person who studied psychology and design sees user behavior differently from the pure designer. A person who learned sales and philosophy closes deals differently than the pure salesman. A person who understands fitness and business builds health companies that MBAs can’t comprehend.

一个学过心理学和设计的人看待用户行为的方式与纯粹的设计师不同。一个学过销售和哲学的人达成交易的方式与纯粹的销售员不同。一个懂健身和商业的人建立的健康公司是 MBA 们无法理解的。

---

Your edge lies more in intersection than it does in expertise.

你的优势更多在于交叉领域，而非专业知识。

---

This is the exact pattern we see in the Renaissance that is coming back with a much stronger force now.

这正是我们在文艺复兴时期看到的模式，现在它正以更强大的力量回归。

---

Consider what made it possible...

考虑一下是什么使之成为可能……

---

Before the printing press, knowledge was scarce.

在印刷机出现之前，知识是稀缺的。

---

Books were copied by hand. A single text could take a scribe months to reproduce. Libraries were rare. Literacy was rarer. If you wanted to learn something outside your trade, you either had access to a monastery or you didn’t learn it.

书籍是手抄的。一个文本可能需要抄写员花上几个月的时间来复制。图书馆很罕见。识字的人更罕见。如果你想学习行当之外的知识，要么去修道院，要么就没法学。

---

Then Gutenberg changed everything.

接着，古腾堡改变了一切。

---

Within 50 years, 20 million books flooded Europe. Ideas that once took generations to spread now moved in months. Literacy exploded. The cost of knowledge collapsed.

在 50 年内，2000 万本书席卷了欧洲。曾经需要几代人才能传播的观点，现在几个月就能传遍各地。识字率爆炸式增长。知识成本崩塌。

---

For the first time in history, a person could realistically pursue multiple domains of mastery in a single lifetime.

历史上第一次，一个人可以在一辈子里现实地追求并掌握多个领域。

---

The Renaissance was the result.

文艺复兴就是这样诞生的。

---

Da Vinci didn’t pick one thing. He painted, sculpted, engineered, studied anatomy, designed war machines, and mapped the human body. Michelangelo was a painter, sculptor, architect, and poet.

达·芬奇没有只选一件事。他绘画、雕刻、搞工程、研究解剖学、设计战争机器、绘制人体图谱。米开朗基罗是一名画家、雕塑家、建筑师和诗人。

---

Unique minds are finally free to operate the way they are supposed to.

独特的头脑终于可以按照它们本该运行的方式运作了。

---

They were supposed to cross disciplines, synthesize connections, and follow curiosity wherever it led, but most of us never realized that.

他们本应跨越学科，综合联系，并跟随好奇心的指引，但我们大多数人从未意识到这一点。

---

The printing press was the catalyst for a new type of person to emerge. A person who could learn anything, combine everything, and create what no specialist ever could.

印刷机是新型人才出现的催化剂。这种人可以学习任何东西，组合一切事物，并创造出任何专家都无法创造的东西。

---

III – How to turn multiple interests into a lucrative way of life / III – 如何将多种兴趣转化为赚钱的生活方式

There are a few things we know so far:

到目前为止，我们知道了几件事：

---

- You have multiple interests but feel like you can’t keep learning forever
    
- 你有多种兴趣，但觉得不能永远学下去

---

- You have a love for interest-based self-education but have to carve out time outside of your career to do it
    
- 你热爱基于兴趣的自我教育，但必须在职业生涯之外挤出时间去做

---

- You understand the need to become self-sufficient but you feel like you don’t have value worth paying for, yet
    
- 你明白自给自足的必要性，但你觉得自己还没有产生值得别人付费的价值

---

- You need to be able to adapt fast because we don’t know what the future of work looks like
    
- 你需要能够快速适应，因为我们不知道未来的工作会是什么样子

---

The question then is, how do we combine all of these things into one way of life?

接下来的问题是，我们如何将所有这些结合成一种生活方式？

---

How do we combine learning and earning into something you can do for work?

我们如何将学习与赚钱结合成一件你可以当作工作来做的事情？

---

I’ll try to make this as logical as I can.

我会尽量让这符合逻辑。

---

To make money from your interests, you need other people to become interested in them too. That part is trivial. If you became interested in something, other people can too, you simply must learn to persuade.

要通过你的兴趣赚钱，你需要让其他人也对它们感兴趣。这部分很简单。如果你对某件事产生了兴趣，其他人也可以，你只需要学会说服。

---

Further, you need a way for them to pay you. In this context, that usually means you need to sell a product, because you probably aren’t going to find a job that allows you to express your interests, and investing in stocks or real estate (to any effective degree) requires a good amount of capital.

此外，你需要一种让他们付钱给你的方式。在这种情况下，通常意味着你需要销售一种产品。因为你可能找不到一份能够让你表达兴趣的工作，而投资股票或房地产（达到任何有效程度）都需要大量资金。

---

In other words, you need attention.

换句话说，你需要注意力。

---

Attention is one of the last moats.

注意力是最后的护城河之一。

---

Because when anyone can write anything or build any software, which ones are going to win? The ones that people know about. You can have the greatest product in the world, but if nobody knows about it, the person who can capture and hold attention will run laps around you.

因为当任何人都可以写任何东西或构建任何软件时，哪些会胜出？那些人们知晓的东西。你可以拥有世界上最伟大的产品，但如果没人知道，那么能够捕捉并吸住注意力的人就会把你甩在身后。

---

As an aside, and if you’ve been keeping up with the tech space, no, I don’t think everyone will just “build their own software.” Most people don’t even spend 20 minutes cooking their own food. They would rather pay a few bucks for Uber Eats. And people have their own things they want to spend their time on.

顺便提一下，如果你一直在关注科技界，不，我不认为每个人都会“构建自己的软件”。大多数人甚至不愿花 20 分钟做饭，他们宁愿付几块钱点 Uber Eats。人们也有自己想花时间去做的事情。

---

Back to the point:

回到正题：

---

You need to become a creator.

你需要成为一名创造者。

---

Now, before you cringe and leave, I don’t exactly mean becoming a content creator (well… it’s complicated).

现在，在你感到尴尬并离开之前，我的意思不完全是成为一名“内容创作者”（嗯……这很复杂）。

---

I mean that the solution to stop creating for someone else because you need them to give you a paycheck is to create for yourself.

我的意思是，不再为别人创造（因为你需要他们给你发工资）的解决方案是——为自己创造。

---

Humans, by nature, are creators who were convinced that being a machine would lead to the American Dream. We are tool builders at our core. We thrive in any niche because we create solutions to problems. If a lion were put in Alaska, it would not build shelter and clothing. It would die. A lion belongs in its own niche.

人类天生就是创造者，却被说服相信成为一台机器就能实现美国梦。我们的核心是工具制造者。我们能在任何利基市场蓬勃发展，因为我们能创造解决问题的方案。如果把狮子放到阿拉斯加，它不会建造避难所和衣服，它会死掉。狮子属于它自己的生态位。

---

The thing is, every business is a media business now. And remember, you need attention. Where is the attention? Mostly on social media until the next attention preference platform comes around - you’ll need to adapt at that point. So yes, if you have multiple interests, it would be wise to become a “content creator,” but it may be easier to think of social media as a mechanism to get your interests in front of other people. It is one piece of the puzzle to do independent work.

事实是，现在每家公司都是媒体公司。记住，你需要注意力。注意力在哪里？大多在社交媒体上，直到下一个注意力偏好平台出现——到那时你需要再次适应。所以，是的，如果你有多种兴趣，成为一名“内容创作者”是明智的，但可能把社交媒体看作是将你的兴趣展现在他人面前的一种机制会更容易理解。它是开展独立工作的拼图之一。

---

Plus, that covers all of our bases.

此外，这涵盖了我们所有的基础。

---

You love learning? Great, reframe it as “research” and now that’s literally your main job. Most of the things I write about simply come from me learning about my interests and treating social media like I’m “taking notes in public.”

你热爱学习？太好了，把它重新定义为“研究”，现在这简直就是你的主职。我写的大部分内容仅仅源于我对兴趣的学习，并将社交媒体视为我在“公开记笔记”。

---

(You’re already spending time learning, now just spend that time learning in public and boom you have the foundation of a business).

（你已经在花时间学习了，现在只需在公开场合学习，轰隆一声，你就拥有了事业的基础）。

---

You need to become self-sufficient? Well, you’d need a business to do that, and every business needs to attract customers, and you probably don’t give two f*cks about paid ads, SEO, or any other form of marketing. This is what trips many people up because they are only used to doing one specialized task within a business as an employee.

你需要自给自足？那么，你需要一个事业来实现这一点。每个事业都需要吸引客户，而你可能根本不在乎付费广告、SEO 或任何其他形式的营销。这就是让许多人栽跟头的地方，因为他们作为雇员只习惯于在公司内执行一项专门的任务。

---

You need to be able to adapt? Amazing, you can build and launch new products to your audience as fast as you can build them. I have a solid audience, and if my next product were to fail, I have people who would be willing to invest, be a part of the team, or support the next product. You can build your little SaaS company, but if you don’t have distribution, you are putting in marathons of extra leg work into getting capital, finding talent, and getting things off the ground.

你需要能够适应？太棒了，你可以根据构建速度向观众发布新产品。我有稳定的受众，如果我的下一个产品失败了，也会有人愿意投资、加入团队或者支持再下一个产品。你可以构建你的小 SaaS 公司，但如果你没有分发渠道，你就是在为了获取资金、寻找人才和让项目落地而做超负荷的额外工作。

---

No other job or business model allows you to do just that with so much freedom.

没有任何其他工作或商业模式允许你在如此自由的情况下做到这些。

---

But how do you actually start building it?

但你究竟该如何开始构建它呢？

---

How do you tie all of this together?

你该如何将这一切联系在一起？

---

It’s unfortunate that “entrepreneurship” and “business” have become dirty words that make people think they aren’t qualified to take that path, so much so that when an opportunity comes up, they don’t even notice it.

遗憾的是，“创业”和“商业”已经变成了贬义词，让人们觉得自己没有资格走这条路，以至于当机会出现时，他们甚至都没有注意到。

---

> If you’ve ever helped someone with your interests, you’re qualified to start a business.

> “如果你曾用你的兴趣帮助过别人，你就有资格创业。”

---

They no longer require upfront capital. They are not reserved for unethical elites. They are not only for people who want to make a lot of money. And they are not only for talented or special people.

创业不再需要前期资金。它们不是不道德精英的专利。它们不仅仅是为了那些想赚大钱的人。它们也不仅仅是为了有天赋或特别的人。

---

The reality is that entrepreneurship is in our nature. It is modern survival. We are wired to create and distribute value to a tribe of like-minded people. We are wired to hunt, explore the unknown, seek novelty, and never stagnate. Psychologically, this is the most enjoyable way of life, even if there are low periods, because those are what allow the (non-artificial) highs to exist.

现实情况是，创业是人类的天性。它是现代社会的生存方式。我们天生就会为志同道合的群体创造和分发价值。我们天生就会捕猎、探索未知、寻求新奇且永不停滞。从心理学上讲，这是最令人享受的生活方式，即使有低谷期，因为正是那些低谷才让（非人造的）巅峰显得有意义。

---

Further, the barrier of entry has collapsed.

此外，准入门槛已经崩塌。

---

All you really need is a laptop and internet connection.

你真正需要的只是一台笔记本电脑和互联网连接。

---

Distribution is now free thanks to social media (well, not free, but skill-based, which can be expensive in time). Anyone can post an idea that reaches millions, and if they have a product, those millions of eyes can result in millions of dollars if you know what you’re doing, and that’s a big if. Most people just love becoming really good at an interest or skill that doesn’t directly impact their success, potentially because they’re afraid of it.

感谢社交媒体，分发现在是免费的（好吧，不是完全免费，而是基于技能的，这可能在时间上很昂贵）。任何人都可以发布一个触达数百万人的想法，如果你知道自己在做什么，如果你有产品，那数百万双眼睛就能转化成数百万美元——这是一个巨大的前提。大多数人只是喜欢通过钻研某个兴趣或技能变得非常厉害，但这些东西并不能直接影响他们的成功，可能因为他们对真正的成功感到恐惧。

---

Tools and technology now handle what used to require teams of people. You have access to AI and a plethora of useful software.

现在的工具和技术可以处理过去需要团队来完成的工作。你可以使用 AI 和大量有用的软件。

---

Now, there are 2 paths you can take to start.

现在，你可以选择两条路开始。

---

Path 1) Skill-Based

路径 1）基于技能

---

This is what dominated the internet for the longest time. You “learn a marketable skill.” You teach that skill through content. Then you sell a product or service related to that skill.

这是长期以来主导互联网的模式。你“学习一项有市场价值的技能”。你通过内容教授这项技能。然后，你销售与该技能相关的产品或服务。

---

The limitation here is the limitation of being a specialist. It is one-dimensional. You put yourself in a box. You “niche down” because you were told it is more profitable, and since you’re chasing profit over interest, you tend to build yourself into a second 9-5 where you do work you don’t care about for people you don’t care about.

这里的局限性在于专家的局限性。它是单一维度的。你把自己禁锢在一个盒子里。你“缩减定位”是因为有人告诉你这样做利润更高。既然你追求的是利润而非兴趣，你往往会把自己带入第二个“朝九晚五”，为那些你不在乎的人做你并不关心的工作。

---

Path 2) Development-Based

路径 2）基于发展

---

The creators that win right now are those without a niche they can be pinned down to. Typically, they are focused on one of the 4 eternal markets: health, wealth, relationships, happiness. Or even all of them. Technically, everyone’s niche is self-actualization, they are just all taking infinitely unique paths to get there.

现在胜出的创造者是那些没有固定定位、无法被贴标签的人。通常，他们专注于四大永恒市场之一：健康、财富、人际关系、幸福。或者甚至是全部。从技术上讲，每个人的利基市场都是自我实现，他们只是都在采取无限独特的路径来实现目标。

---

- They pursue your own goals (brand).
    
- 他们追求自己的目标（品牌）。

---

- They teach what you learn (content).
    
- 他们传授他们所学到的知识（内容）。

---

- They help others achieve the goal faster (product).

- 他们帮助他人更快地实现目标（产品）。

---

For those with multiple interests, I obviously recommend this path, because it goes a bit deeper.

对于那些有多种兴趣的人，我显然推荐这条路，因为它更深入。

---

First, when you take this path, you are also taking the first path. Because building your brand, content, and product requires you to become good at all of the relevant marketable skills, so even if you fail, you have something worth paying for. You are building your business, and you can help others with a specific part of theirs if you are good at it.

首先，当你走这条路时，你实际上也在走第一条路。因为建立你的品牌、内容和产品需要你精通所有相关的、有市场价值的技能。所以即使你失败了，你也拥有值得别人付费的东西。你在建立自己的事业，如果你擅长其中某个部分，你就可以帮助别人的事业。

---

Second, it flips the traditional model on its head.

其次，它颠覆了传统模式。

---

You don’t create a customer avatar so that you can niche down and only focus on that. You turn yourself into the customer avatar.

你不是为了缩减定位并只专注于某个特定点而创建一个客户画像。你是把自己变成了那个客户画像。

---

That makes things much more palatable.

这让事情变得容易接受得多。

You pursue your goals in life and develop yourself → you have already validated the usefulness of what you will offer → you help the past version of yourself reach that same goal.

你追求人生目标并发展自我 → 你已经验证了你将提供的东西的实用性 → 你帮助过去的自己实现同一个目标。

Don’t be a YouTube creator.

不要做一个 YouTube 创作者。

Don’t be a personal brand.

不要做一个个人品牌。

---

Don’t be an influencer.

不要做一个网红。

Be you. But in a place where your work can be discovered, followed, and supported. Right now and for the foreseeable future, that’s on the internet.

做你自己。但在一个能让你的作品被发现、被关注、被支持的地方。现在以及可预见的未来，那个地方就是互联网。

Jordan Peterson (or others like him) isn’t a “content creator,” even though that’s how it seems on the surface.

乔丹·彼得森（或其他像他这样的人）并不是一名“内容创作者”，尽管表面上看是这样。

---

He goes on tours, writes books, leverages social media as a base, and uses all of the tools at his disposal to spread his life’s work. He isn’t worried about the latest content idea trend. His mind outperforms any of those myopic growth strategies. The quality of his ideas is what sets him apart and changes people’s lives (regardless of your opinion on Peterson).

他进行巡演、写书、利用社交媒体作为大本营，并使用他能支配的所有工具来传播他毕生的心血。他并不担心最新的内容创意趋势。他的思想超越了任何目光短浅的增长策略。他思想的质量使他脱颖而出，并改变了人们的生活（无论你对彼得森的看法如何）。

---

With that, I want to provide a different perspective on brand, content, and product. That way you can use this as a vessel for your life’s work.

说到这里，我想提供一个关于品牌、内容和产品的不同视角。这样你就可以将此作为你毕生事业的载体。

V – Brand is an environment / V – 品牌是一种环境

Stop thinking of your brand as a profile picture and social media bio.

不要再把你的品牌仅仅看作是一张头像和一段社交媒体简介。

---

Brand is an environment where people come to transform.

品牌是一个人们前来转化的环境。

---

Brand is the little world you are inviting others into.

品牌是你邀请他人进入的小世界。

---

Brand isn’t illustrated when a reader first visits your profile.

读者第一次访问你的个人资料时，品牌并不会被完全展现出来。

---

Brand is the accumulation of ideas in your reader’s mind after 3-6 months of following you.

品牌是读者在关注你 3-6 个月后，在脑海中累积的想法。

---

You illustrate your worldview, story, and philosophy for life across every single touchpoint. Your banner, profile picture, bio, link in bio, landing page design, pinned content, posts, threads, newsletters, videos, and the rest.

你通过每一个接触点来阐述你的世界观、故事和人生哲学。你的横幅、头像、简介、个人网站链接、落地页设计、置顶内容、帖子、推文串、时事通讯、视频等等。

---

In other words, your brand is this:

换句话说，你的品牌就是这个：

---

Your brand is your story.

你的品牌就是你的故事。

---

It would help to spend a day writing out where you came from, the “low” points of your life, the experiences you’ve had and skills you’ve acquired, and how those things have helped you the most.

花一天时间写下你从哪里来、人生的“低谷”期、你拥有的经历和习得的技能，以及这些东西是如何给予你最大帮助的，这会有所裨益。

---

When you’re thinking of ideas, content, or products, you should filter them through your story. This doesn’t mean you have to talk about yourself all the time. It means you have to align what you’re saying so that your brand is cohesive.

当你构思想法、内容或产品时，你应该通过你的故事来过滤它们。这并不意味着你必须一直谈论自己。它意味着你必须调整你的表达，使你的品牌具有凝聚力。

---

The difficult part is realizing that your story is worth telling, even if you think it’s boring or haven’t reflected on your growth.

难点在于意识到你的故事值得讲述，即使你认为它很枯燥，或者还没有反思过自己的成长。

---

The point:

重点是：

---

Your bio and profile picture do not matter. There are literal people with one word in their bio and a singular color for their profile picture.

你的简介和头像并不重要。有些人简介里只有一个词，头像只有一种颜色。

---

My recommendation:

我的建议：

---

- Make a list of 5-10 people you respect online
    
- 列出一份你在网上尊敬的 5-10 人的名单

---

- Look at their profile picture, bio, and content
    
- 观察他们的头像、简介和内容

---

- Take mental note of patterns between them
    
- 在脑海中记下他们之间的共同模式

---

- Start formulating what you should do for your own brand, with your own little spin
    
- 开始构思你该如何打造自己的品牌，并加入你的一点独特之处

---

In all honesty, I wouldn’t overcomplicate this or even worry about it. Your brand will take shape as you start writing content. We could even say that brand is content, so we need to get that right.

老实说，我不会把这件事复杂化，甚至不会为此担心。当你开始编写内容时，你的品牌就会成型。我们甚至可以说品牌就是内容，所以我们需要把内容做好。

VI – Content is novel perspectives / VI – 内容是新颖的视角

The internet is a fire hose of information.

互联网是信息的消防栓（喷涌而出，令人应接不暇）。

---

AI is only adding more noise.

AI 只是在增加更多的噪音。

---

That means trust and signal are more important than ever.

这意味着信任和信号比以往任何时候都更加重要。

---

In my opinion, the guiding light for your content should be to curate the best possible ideas in one place. Your brand is a collection of all the ideas you care about, in your own words, under one account on the internet.

在我看来，你内容的指路明灯应该是将尽可能好的想法汇集在一处。你的品牌是用你自己的语言，在互联网的一个账号下，收集所有你关心的想法。

---

If you have any plans to do podcasts or public speaking, notice how the best speakers always have 5-10 of their best arguments or ideas top of mind. They repeat these over and over and that’s how they build influence. If you don’t have a set of those 5-10 ideas, then you won’t be as impactful as you could be. Writing a truckload of content is how you discover those ideas.

如果你有任何做播客或公开演讲的计划，请注意那些最好的讲演者脑海中总是存着 5-10 个他们最好的论点或想法。他们一遍又一遍地重复这些，这就是他们建立影响力的方式。如果你没有这样一套 5-10 个想法，你就无法发挥出应有的影响力。编写大量的内容就是你发现这些想法的过程。

---

Once the “idea density” of your content increases with time and effort, that’s what creates a brand worth following and paying for.

随着时间和精力的投入，你内容的“构思密度”会增加，这正是打造一个值得关注和付费的品牌的关键。

---

The goal of curating ideas to include under your brand should fall at the intersection of:

策划要包含在品牌下的想法时，目标应该落在以下两者的交汇点：

---

- Performance – the ideas have the potential to “do well.” This is the measure of how much other people will care.
    
- 表现（Performance）——想法有“表现出色”的潜力。这是衡量其他人在意程度的标准。

---

- Excitement – the ideas give you a sense of excitement to write about them. This is the measure of how much you care.

- 兴奋（Excitement）——想法能让你有动力去写。这是衡量你在意程度的标准。

---

Art and business.

艺术与商业。

---

Metrics and performance shouldn’t determine everything, but they do mean something.

指标和表现不应决定一切，但它们确实有一定的意义。

Step 1) Build an idea museum

步骤 1）建立一个构思博物馆

---

The secret of most creatives you love is that they keep a ruthless curation of notes, ideas, and sources of inspiration.

你喜欢的大多数创意人的秘密在于，他们会对笔记、想法和灵感来源进行冷酷无情的筛选。

---

In other words, they have a “swipe file,” as marketers call it.

换句话说，他们有一个营销人员所说的“灵感库（swipe file）”。

（如果你有访问权限）、Apple Notes、Notion 或任何你想要的东西，但我想说得很清楚：

---

You need somewhere to jot down ideas as soon as they come to mind.

你需要一个地方，能在想法出现时立即记录下来。

---

This is a critical habit.

这是一个关键的习惯。

---

Whenever you find an idea that is useful, either now or in the near future, write it down. You don’t need content pillars or 2-3 topics to talk about. The ideas you curate should simply be important to you. That alone means they are relevant to a specific niche of a person: you. However, you can create a

每当你发现一个现在或不久的将来有用的想法时，把它写下来。你不需要内容支柱或两三个要谈论的话题。你策划的想法只需要对你来说很重要即可。仅凭这一点，就意味着它们与一个特定的利基人群相关：你自己。不过，如果你愿意，你可以创建一个

。

---

I don’t care how you structure this. It can be a neat and organized set of documents, or it can be a messy running note without structure. The habit matters more than the format.

我不关心你如何构建它。它可以是一套整洁有序的文档，也可以是一份没有结构的凌乱随笔。习惯比格式更重要。

---

You gauge performance by glancing at the likes, views, or general engagement of a post to see if it has the potential to resonate. If the idea falls flat or does worse than their other content, it probably won’t do well for you.

你通过观察帖子的点赞数、浏览量或总体互动情况来衡量表现，看看它是否有引起共鸣的潜力。如果这个想法反响平平，或者比他们的其他内容表现更差，那么它对你来说可能也不会表现得很好。

---

You gauge excitement by noticing when you feel as if you are wasting something valuable if you don’t write it down.

你通过察觉那种“如果不写下来就会浪费掉宝贵东西”的感觉，来衡量兴奋度。

---

Step 2) Curate based on idea density

步骤 2）基于构思密度进行筛选

---

How do you start filling your idea museum?

你如何开始充实你的构思博物馆？

---

You need 3-5 sources of information that have high idea density.

你需要 3-5 个具有高构思密度的信息源。

---

When I say “idea density,” I mean an idea that is high signal.

当我谈到“构思密度”时，我指的是高信号的想法。

---

It’s difficult to explain how to find something that is high signal, because that is subjective. It’s dependent on your level of development (what’s useful for you), your audience’s level of development (what’s useful for them), and your translation from one to another.

很难解释如何寻找高信号的东西，因为那是主观的。它取决于你的发展水平（对你有用的东西）、受众的发展水平（对他们有用的东西），以及你在这两者之间的转化。

---

The most basic piece of advice could be the most valuable thing in the world for someone else, but it may seem like common knowledge to you.

最基本的建议对别人来说可能是世界上最有价值的东西，但对你来说可能只是常识。

---

With time, you will tune your own signal-to-noise ratio by seeing what ideas resonate with your audience and which don’t.

随着时间的推移，通过观察哪些想法能引起观众共鸣，哪些不能，你将调整你自己的信噪比。

---

The most idea-dense sources of information:

构思密度最高的信息源：

---

- Old or little-known books – I have 5 books that I reread over and over again because the ideas are so good. These are where the timeless principles live, untouched by trends.
    
- 经典的或冷门的书籍——我有 5 本书会一遍又一遍地读，因为里面的想法太棒了。这里是永恒原则所在的地方，不受潮流的影响。

---

- Curated blogs, accounts, or books – Blogs like Farnam Street curate the best ideas from modern intellectuals. Accounts like Navalism curate Naval’s best ideas. Books like The Maxwell Daily Reader have one of Maxwell’s best ideas one day at a time for a year. These do a lot of the heavy lifting for you, allowing you to pick and choose the best of the best.
    
- 精选的博客、账号或书籍——像 Farnam Street 这样的博客汇集了现代知识分子的最佳想法。像 Navalism 这样的账号汇集了 Naval 最好的想法。《Maxwell Daily Reader》这样的书在一年里每天提供一个麦克斯韦最好的想法。这些都为你分担了大量繁重的工作，让你能够优中选优。

---

- Heavy-hitting social accounts – I have a list of maybe 5 social accounts that always post great ideas. If I don’t have something to write about, I’ll scroll through their page and find something I have an opinion on and write about that.

- 重量级的社交账号——我有一份可能包含 5 个社交账号的名单，他们总是发布很棒的想法。如果我没什么可写的，我就会浏览他们的页面，找一个我有看法的主题来写。

---

Finding these sources takes a few months of discovery. But the result of maintaining an idea museum of dense ideas leads to you creating idea-dense content.

寻找这些来源需要几个月的探索。但维护一个充满高密度构思的构思博物馆，最终会让你创作出高密度的内容。

---

Your idea museum becomes a representation of the mind you are attempting to create.

你的构思博物馆成了你试图塑造的思想的缩写。

---

That’s the ultimate goal.

那是终极目标。

---

To have a library of content so good that people can’t help but open your emails, turn on post notifications, share your ideas with friends, and think about your ideas often.

拥有一个内容如此优秀的库，以至于人们忍不住打开你的邮件、开启新帖通知、把你的想法分享给朋友，并时常思考你的想法。

---

> You become a curator of ideas that people wouldn’t even think to ask AI for, and that people would never come across organically.

> “你成为了那些人们甚至想不到去问 AI、且永远无法有机地接触到的想法的策划者。”

---

That’s how you become less dependent on the algorithm for your success.

这就是你如何减少成功对算法的依赖。

---

Step 3) Write 1 idea 1000 different ways

步骤 3）一思千写（将一个想法用 1000 种不同方式表达）

---

Becoming a good writer or speaker isn’t only about the idea, but how the idea is articulated.

成为一名优秀的作家或演说家不全在于想法，还在于想法是如何表达的。

---

The idea does a lot of the heavy lifting, but the structure is what makes it engaging, unique, and impactful.

想法承担了大部分工作，但结构决定了其是否吸引人、是否有独特性且是否有影响力。

---

Let me show you what I mean.

让我展示一下我的意思。

---

Take this post structure:

以这个帖子结构为例：

---

> One pattern I’ve noticed in happy people: They’re obsessive about maintaining their mental clarity.

> “我在快乐人群中观察到的一个模式：他们沉迷于保持头脑清晰。”

---

The idea here is that happy people maintain their mental clarity.

这里的核心想法是，快乐的人保持头脑清晰。

---

The structure is formatted in 2 parts: a hook in the form of an observation, and the delivery of what the observation is.

结构分为两部分：以观察形式呈现的诱饵（hook），以及对观察内容的交代。

---

It seems simple, but the difference in the structure of an idea can make all the difference.

这看起来很简单，但想法结构的不同可以产生天壤之别。

---

Now, if I take the same idea but use a “list” structure:

现在，如果我采用相同的想法但使用“列表”结构：

---

> Happy people are clear-minded people: – They take time for rest – They focus on one singular goal – They ruthlessly eliminate distractions In other words, happy people are obsessive about maintaining their mental clarity.

> “快乐的人是头脑清晰的人：——他们花时间休息；——他们专注于单一目标；——他们无情地消除分心。换句话说，快乐的人对保持头脑清晰非常执着。”

---

Same idea. Different structure. Different impact.

相同的想法，不同的结构，不同的影响力。

---

If you wanted to, you could practice writing the same idea with every single post structure you come across.

如果你愿意，你可以练习针对你遇到的每一种帖子结构来重写同一个想法。

---

Here’s how to practice this:

这里是如何练习的方法：

---

First, break down 3 ideas into their structure.

首先，将 3 个想法拆解为它们的结构。

---

Choose 3 posts from your idea museum that resonated with you. Then, try to break down each part of the idea and write why it works.

从你的构思博物馆中选择 3 个引起你共鸣的帖子。然后，尝试拆解想法的每个部分，并写下它奏效的原因。

---

If you don’t have experience with content psychology, that’s okay. You learn it as you practice.

如果你没有内容心理学方面的经验，那没关系。你在练习中就能学会。

---

This is the perfect time to employ AI for help. Try this prompt for each post:

这是寻求 AI 帮助的最佳时机。为每篇帖子尝试这个提示词：

---

> Do a comprehensive analysis on this social post. The overall idea, how the sentences are structured, and choice of words. Analyze why people engage with it, why it works so well, what psychological tactics are being used, and how I can replicate this style step-by-step with my own ideas.

> “对这篇社交帖子进行全面分析。整体构思、句子结构以及选词。分析人们为什么与之互动，它为什么效果这么好，运用了哪些心理技巧，以及我该如何分步骤地用我自己的想法复制这种风格。”

---

Then paste the post below the prompt.

然后将帖子粘贴在提示词下方。

---

I’d recommend Claude as the model to use for this over ChatGPT or Gemini.

我建议在这个任务中使用 Claude 模型，而不是 ChatGPT 或 Gemini。

---

Continue doing this for any idea you find along your journey that you want to incorporate as part of your writing style. You can use this for videos as well, not just posts.

在你探索的过程中，针对任何你想融入到自己写作风格中的想法，继续这样做。你也可以把这用于视频，而不仅仅是帖子。

---

Second, rewrite 3 ideas with different structures.

其次，用不同的结构重写 3 个想法。

---

Go back to your idea museum and choose one idea you didn’t use in step one.

回到你的构思博物馆，选择一个你在步骤一中没用过的想法。

---

Then, try rewriting that idea with the 3 post structures you just broke down.

然后，尝试用你刚刚拆解的 3 种帖子结构来重写那个想法。

---

This is how you develop range.

这就是你如何培养广度（表现力范围）。

---

This is how you stop staring at blank screens.

这就是你如何不再盯着空白屏幕发呆。

---

This is how you turn one idea into a week’s worth of content.

这就是你如何将一个想法转化为一周内容的方法。

---

Why are we doing this?

我们为什么要这样做？

---

Well, you now have all of the secrets to creating content that stands out and coming up with good ideas.

现在，你已经掌握了创作脱颖而出的内容和构思好点子的所有秘密。

---

Seriously, those are the secrets. Any results that come from them are a matter of practice.

说真的，这些就是秘密。由此产生的任何结果都取决于练习。

There are tons of writing products out there, so what’s different about my 2 Hour Writer product, as an example? Or even Eden, the software that I’m building that could “easily be replaced by Google Drive or Dropbox,” according to super smart people who have definitely built successful products in the YouTube comments?

外面有成千上万的写作产品，那么以我的“2 小时写作课（2 Hour Writer）”为例，它有什么不同呢？或者说我正在开发的软件 Eden，按照 YouTube 评论区里那些肯定开发过成功产品的“绝顶聪明”的人的说法，它“可以轻易被 Google Drive 或 Dropbox 取代”，那它又有什么不同呢？

---

They’re systems that I created by getting results for myself.

它们是我通过为自己取得成果而创建的系统。

2HW doesn’t teach a bunch of academic writing nonsense that doesn’t help you achieve our shared vision of living a creative and meaningful life.

“2 小时写作课”不教那些对你实现我们共同愿景（过上有创意且有意义的生活）毫无帮助的学术写作废话。

---

I had a few problems:

我曾遇到过几个问题：

---

- I had trouble having an endless source of content ideas.
    
- 我很难拥有源源不断的内容创意。

---

- I didn’t want to waste a ton of time creating content for all different platforms.

- 我不想浪费大量时间为所有不同平台创作内容。

---

So, I started experimenting with my own system.

于是，我开始尝试建立自己的系统。

---

My goal for the system was clear: write all of the content I need to in under 2 hours a day. That way my audience growth is handled and I can focus on building better products and enjoying life.

我这个系统的目标很明确：每天在 2 小时内写完我需要的所有内容。这样我的受众增长就搞定了，我可以专注于开发更好的产品和享受生活。

---

I started testing solutions to have more content ideas.

我开始测试能产生更多内容创意的解决方案。

---

I created swipe files, steps to generate ideas, and templates if I still couldn’t think of anything.

我创建了灵感库、产生创意的步骤，以及在实在想不出东西时可以使用的模板。

---

I mapped out exactly what I was going to attempt to write each week: 3 posts a day, 1 thread a week, and 1 newsletter a week.

我精确勾勒出每周打算写的内容：每天 3 篇帖子，每周 1 个推文串，每周 1 份时事通讯。

---

During that process, I realized I could cross-post my writing to all social platforms (this is public, you can see it). I also realized that threads could be turned into carousels, and newsletters could be turned into YouTube videos.

在这个过程中，我意识到我可以将我写的东西同步发布到所有社交平台（这是公开的，你可以看到）。我还意识到，推文串可以转化为轮播图，时事通讯可以转化为 YouTube 视频。

---

If the system didn’t flow, I would try new things the next week.

如果系统运行不顺畅，我会在下周尝试新方法。

---

From there, I realized I could copy paste my newsletter to my blog, embed the YT video in that blog, promote my products in that blog, and turn that blog into more content ideas.

从此，我意识到我可以把时事通讯复制粘贴到博客上，在博客里嵌入 YouTube 视频，在博客里推广我的产品，并将那篇博客转化为更多的内容创意。

---

Then, I could link that blog under my content each day.

然后，我每天可以在我的内容下方链接那个博客。

---

This led to more newsletter subscribers, YouTube subscribers, and product sales.

这带动了更多的时事通讯订阅者、YouTube 订阅者和产品销售额。

---

I realized that if everything I did was newsletter centric, that’s all I had to worry about for both growing my audience and promoting my products.

我意识到，如果我所做的一切都以时事通讯为中心，那么无论是增长受众还是推广产品，我只需要担心这一件事。

---

That’s how you stand out in a world of copy paste products.

这就是你在一个充满“复制粘贴式产品”的世界中脱颖而出的方式。
