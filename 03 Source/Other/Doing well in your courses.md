# Doing well in your courses / 如何在课程中取得优异成绩

a guide by Andrej Karpathy

安德烈·卡帕斯（Andrej Karpathy）撰写的指南

---

Here is some advice I would give to younger students if they wish to do well in their undergraduate courses.

如果年轻学生希望在本科课程中表现出色，以下是我会给他们的一些建议。

---

Having been tested for many years of my life (with pretty good results), here are some rules of thumb that I feel helped me:

在我的人生中经历了多年的考试（并取得了相当不错的成绩），以下是一些我觉得对我很有帮助的经验法则：

---

## GENERAL / 常规建议

### All-nighters are not worth it. / 熬夜并不值得

Sleep does wonders. Optimal sleep time for me is around 7.5 hours, with an absolute minimum of around 4hrs.

睡眠具有神奇的效果。对我来说，最佳睡眠时间约为 7.5 小时，绝对最低限度约为 4 小时。

---

It has happened to me several times that I was stuck on some problem for an hour in the night, but was able to solve it in 5 minutes in the morning. I feel like the brain "commits" a lot of shaky short-term memories to stable long-term memories during the night. I try to start studying for any big tests well in advance (several days), even if for short periods of time, to maximize the number of nights that my brain gets for the material.

我曾多次遇到这样的情况：晚上困在一个问题上一个小时都没解决，但早上只用 5 分钟就搞定了。我觉得大脑会在夜间将许多不稳定的短期记忆转化为稳定的长期记忆。我会尝试提前很久（几天）就开始为重大考试做准备，即使每次时间很短，也是为了最大限度地增加大脑处理学习材料的夜晚天数。

---

### Attend tutorials or review sessions. / 参加辅导课或复习课

Even if they are bad. The fact that they get you to think about the material is what counts. If its too boring, you can always work on something else. Remember that you can also try to attend a different tutorial with a different TA.

即使这些课程质量不高也要去。关键在于它们能促使你思考所学材料。如果内容太枯燥，你总可以做点别的事情。记住，你也可以尝试参加由不同助教（TA）讲授的其他辅导课。

---

## TESTS: PREPARATION / 考试准备

### Considering the big picture and organisation is the key. / 宏观把握与组织安排是关键

Create schedule of study, even if you dont stick to it. For me this usually involves getting an idea of everything I need to know and explicitly writing it down in terms of bullet points. Consider all points carefully and think about how long it will take you to get them down. If you don't do this, there is a tendency to spend too much time on beginning of material and then skim through the (most important) later material due to lack of time.

制定学习计划，哪怕你最后没有完全遵守。对我来说，这通常涉及了解所有需要掌握的内容，并用要点形式明确写下来。仔细考虑每一个知识点，并思考掌握它们需要多长时间。如果你不这样做，往往会倾向于在早期的材料上花费过多时间，最后因为时间不足而草草翻阅（往往是最重要的）后期材料。

---

### Always try to look at previous tests BEFORE starting to study. / 务必在开始学习前查看往年试题

Especially if the past tests were written by the same professor. This will give you strong hints about how you should study. Every professor has a different evaluation style. Don't actually attempt to complete the questions in the beginning, but take careful note of the type of questions.

特别是如果往年的考试是由同一位教授出的题。这会为你提供关于如何学习的强力提示。每个教授都有不同的考核风格。一开始不要真的尝试去完整回答问题，但要仔细留意问题的类型。

---

### Reading and understanding IS NOT the same as replicating the content. / 阅读理解与复现内容并非一回事

Even I often make this mistake still: You read a formula/derivation/proof in the book and it makes perfect sense. Now close the book and try to write it down. You will find that this process is completely different and it will amaze you that many times you won't actually be able to do this! Somehow the two things use different parts of the memory. Make it a point to make sure that you can actually write down the most important bits, and that you can re-derive them at will. Feynman famously [knew this](http://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand) very well.

即使是我现在也经常犯这个错误：你在书上看到一个公式、推导或证明，觉得非常有道理。现在闭上书，尝试把它写下来。你会发现这个过程完全不同，而且你会惊讶地发现，很多时候你实际上写不出来！不知由于何种原因，这两件事使用的是记忆的不同部分。务必确保你能真正写下最重要的部分，并能随意重新推导它们。费曼对此也是众所周知的[深有感触](http://www.quora.com/What-did-Richard-Feynman-mean-when-he-said-What-I-cannot-create-I-do-not-understand)。

---

### Always try to collaborate with others, but near the end. / 始终尝试与他人合作，但要放在最后阶段

Study alone first because in the early stages of studying others can only serve as a distraction. But near the end get together with others: they will often point out important pitfalls, bring up good issues, and sometimes give you an opportunity to teach. Which brings me to:

先独自学习，因为在学习的早期阶段，他人只会分散你的注意力。但在接近结束时，和他人聚在一起：他们经常会指出重要的陷阱，提出好的问题，有时还会给你一个教别人的机会。这引出了下一点：

---

### Don't only hang out only with stronger students. / 不要只和比你强的学生混在一起

Weaker students will have you explain things to them and you will find that teaching the material helps A LOT with understanding.

程度稍弱的学生会让你给他们解释问题，而你会发现，教授这些材料对加深理解非常有帮助。

---

### Go to the prof before final exam at least once for office hours. / 期末考试前至少去见一次教授

Even if you have no questions (make something up!) Profs will sometimes be willing to say more about a test in 1on1 basis (things they would not disclose in front of the entire class). Don't expect it, but when this does happen, it helps a lot. Does this give you an unfair advantage over other students? Sometimes. It's a little shady:)

哪怕你没有问题（编也得编一个！）。教授们有时愿意在一对一的情况下透露更多关于考试的信息（那些他们不会在全班面前公开的事情）。不要抱太大期望，但当这种情况发生时，确实非常有帮助。这是否让你相对于其他学生拥有了不公平的优势？有时确实如此。这确实有点“耍小聪明”:)

---

But in general it is a good idea to let the prof get to know you at least a little.

但总的来说，让教授至少对你有一点了解是一个好主意。

---

### Study well in advance. / 提前很久就开始学习

Did I mention this already? Maybe I should stress it again. The brain really needs time to absorb material. Things that looked hard become easier with time.

我提到过这件事了吗？也许 I should stress it again. 大脑确实需要时间来吸收材料。随着时间的推移，最初看起来很难的东西会变得容易。

---

You want to alocate ~3 days for midterms, ~6 days for exams.

你应该为期中考试分配约 3 天，为期末考试分配约 6 天。

---

### If things are going badly and you get too tired, in emergency situations, jug an energy drink. / 如果情况糟糕且你太累了，在紧急情况下，灌下一瓶能量饮料

They work. It's just chemistry.

它们确实有效。这纯粹是化学反应。

---

### For things like math: Exercise > Reading. / 对于数学之类的学科：练习 > 阅读

It is good to study to the point where you are reasonably ready to start the exercises, but then fill in the gaps through doing exercises, especially if you have many available to you. The exercises will also make you go back and read things you don't know.

学习到能够开始做练习的程度固然很好，但随后应通过做练习来填补空白，尤其是当你有很多练习题可用时。练习还会促使你回头去阅读你不知道的内容。

---

### Make yourself cheat sheet. / 为自己制作“作弊条”

Even if you're not allowed to bring it to the exam. Writing things down helps. What you want is to cram the entire course on 1 or more pages that you can in the end tile in front of you and say with high degree of confidence "This is exactly everything I must know"

即使考试不允许携带也要做。把东西写下来非常有帮助。你的目标是将整门课程压缩到一页或几页纸上，最后你可以把它们铺在面前，并高度自信地说：“这就是我必须知道的所有内容。”

---

### Study in places where other people study as well, even if not the same thing. / 在别人也在学习的地方学习，即使内容不同

This makes you feel bad when you are the one not studying. It works for me:)

当你成为那个不学习的人时，这会让你感觉很糟。这对我有效:)

---

Places with a lot of background noise are bad and have a research-supported negative impact on learning. Libraries and Reading rooms work best.

背景噪音大的地方不好，研究表明这会对学习产生负面影响。图书馆和阅览室的效果最好。

---

## TESTS: ON DAY OF / 考试当天

### Optimal eating/drinking habit is: T-2 hours get coffee and food. / 最佳饮食习惯：考前 2 小时喝咖啡及进食

For me, Coffee or Food RIGHT before the test is ALWAYS bad

对我来说，考前瞬间喝咖啡或吃东西总是糟糕的。

---

Coffee right before any potentially stressful situation is ALWAYS bad.

在任何压力情境前瞬间喝咖啡总是糟糕的。

---

No coffee at all is bad.

完全不喝咖啡也很糟糕。

---

I realize the coffee bit may be subjective to me, but its something to think about for yourself.

我意识到咖啡这点对我来说可能比较主观，但这确实是值得你自己思考的事情。

---

### Study very intensely RIGHT before the test. / 考前瞬间高强度学习

I see many people give up before the test and claim to "take a break". Short term memory is a wonderful thing, don't waste it! Study as intensely as possible right before the test. If you really feel you must take a break, take it about an hour before the test, but make sure you study really hard 30-45 minutes before the test.

我看到很多人在考前放弃，声称要“休息一下”。短期记忆是一件美妙的事情，不要浪费它！在考试前尽可能高强度地学习。如果你真的觉得必须休息，那就考前一小时休息，但务必确保在考前 30-45 分钟内非常努力地学习。

---

## DURING THE TEST / 考试期间

### Always use pencil for tests. / 考试务必使用铅笔

You want to be able to erase your garbage "solutions"

你会希望能够擦掉那些垃圾般的“解答”。

---

### Look over all questions very briefly before start. / 开始前快速浏览所有题目

A mere 1-3 second glance per question is good enough. Just absorb all key words, and get idea of the size of the entire test.

每道题只需扫视 1-3 秒就够了。只需吸收所有关键词，并了解整个考试的规模。

---

### On test, do easy questions first. / 考试时，先做简单的题目

Do not allow yourself to get stuck on something too long. Come back to it later. I skip questions all the time... Sometimes I can complete as little as 30% of the test on my first pass. Some questions somehow become much easier once you're "warmed up", I can't explain it.

不要让自己在某件事上卡住太久。稍后再回来处理。我经常跳过题目……有时我第一遍只能完成考试内容的 30%。有些题目在“热身”之后不知怎么就变得容易多了，我也解释不清原因。

---

### Always try to be neat on the test. / 卷面务必保持整洁

Surprisingly few people actually realize this obvious fact: A human being will mark your test. A sad human being gives low marks. I suspected this as undergrad student and confirmed it strongly when I was TAing and actually marking.

令人惊讶的是，很少有人意识到这个显而易见的事实：评分的是人。一个心情糟糕的人会给低分。我在当本科生时就怀疑这一点，在当助教并实际批改试卷时强烈证实了这一点。

---

### Always BOX IN/CIRCLE the answer / 务必框出或圈出答案

Especially when there is derivation around it. This allows the marker to give you a quick check mark for full marks and move on. Get in the mindset of a marker.

特别是当答案周围有推导过程时。这能让阅卷人快速打勾给出满分并继续批改。要站在阅卷人的角度去思考。

---

### NEVER. EVER. EVER. Leave test early. / 绝对、绝对、绝对不要提前交卷

You made a silly mistake (I guarantee it), find it and fix it. If you can't find it, try harder until time runs out. If you are VERY certain of no mistakes, work on making test more legible and easier to mark. Erase garbage, box in answers, add steps to proofs, etc.

你犯了一个愚蠢的错误（我保证），找到它并改正。如果你找不到，就再努力找，直到时间耗尽。如果你非常确定没有错误，就去提高试卷的可读性，使其更容易评分。擦掉垃圾内容、框出答案、为证明增加步骤等。

---

I have no other way of putting this-- people who leave tests early are stupid. This is a clear example of a situation where potential benefits completely outweigh the cost.

我只能这么说——提前交卷的人很愚蠢。这是一个潜在收益完全覆盖成本的典型案例。

---

### Communicate with the marker. / 与阅卷人沟通

Show the marker that you know more than what you put down. Ok you can't do a particular step, but make it clear that you know how to proceed if you did. Don't be afraid to leave notes when necessary. Believe it or not the markers often end up trying to find you more marks-- make it easy for them.

向阅卷人展示你所知道的比你写下来的更多。好吧，你可能做不出特定的一步，但要清楚地表达出如果你做出来了该如何后续进行。必要时不要害怕留下备注。信不信由你，阅卷人最终经常会试图为你寻找更多的分——让他们容易操作一些。

---

### Consider number of points per question. / 考虑每道题的分值

Many tests will tell you how many marks every question is worth. This can give you very strong hints when you are doing something wrong. It also gives you strong hints at what questions you should be working on. It is, of course, silly to spend too much time on questions worth little marks that are still relatively hard for you.

许多考试会告诉你每道题值多少分。当你做错时，这能给你强烈的提示。它也能强烈提示你应该把精力放在哪些题目上。当然，在那些分值低且对你来说相对较难的题目上花费过多时间是很愚蠢的。

---

### If there are <5 minutes left and you are still stuck on some question, STOP. / 如果只剩不到 5 分钟而你仍卡在某道题上，立即停下

Your time is better spent re-reading all questions and making absolutely sure you did not miss any secondary questions, and that you answered everything. You wouldn't believe how many silly marks people lose this way.

你的时间最好花在重新阅读所有题目上，绝对确保你没有遗漏任何次要问题，并且回答了所有内容。你简直无法想象人们因为这种方式丢了多少冤枉分。

---

## Last / 最后

Congratulations if you got all the way here! Now that you are here, here's my last (very important advice). It is something that I wish someone had told me when I was an undergraduate.

祝贺你读到了这里！既然你已经在这里了，这是我最后的（非常重要的）建议。这是我希望有人在我读本科时就能告诉我的事情。

---

Undergrads tend to have tunnel vision about their classes. They want to get good grades, etc. The crucial fact to realize is that noone will care about your grades, unless they are bad. For example, I always used to say that the smartest student will get 85% in all of his courses. This way, you end up with somewhere around 4.0 score, but you did not over-study, and you did not under-study.

本科生往往对课程存在片面的狭隘视野。他们想要拿高分等等。关键要意识到的一点是，除非成绩很差，否则没人会在乎你的分数。例如，我过去常说，最聪明的学生会在所有课程中都拿 85 分。这样一来，你最终会得到 4.0 左右的绩点，既没有过度学习，也没有学习不足。

---

Your time is a precious, limited resource. Get to a point where you don't screw up on a test and then switch your attention to much more important endeavors. What are they?

你的时间是宝贵且有限的资源。达到考试不出差错的程度，然后将注意力转移到更重要的事业上。它们是什么？

---

Getting actual, real-world experience, working on real code base, projects or problems outside of silly course exercises is extremely imporant. Professors/People who know you and can write you a good reference letter saying that you have initiative, passion and drive are extremely important. Are you thinking of applying to jobs? Get a summer internship. Are you thinking of pursuing graduate school? Get research experience! Sign up for whatever programs your school offers. Or reach out to a professor/graduate student asking to get involved on a research project you like. This might work if they think you're driven and motivated enough. Do not underestimate the importance of this: A well-known professor who writes in their recommendation letter that you are driven, motivated and independent thinker completely dwarfs anything else, especially petty things like grades. It also helps a lot if you squeeze in at least one paper before you apply. Also, you should be aware that the biggest pet peeve from their side are over-excited undergrad students who sign up for a project, meet a few times, ask many questions, and then suddenly give up and disappear after all that time investment from the graduate student's or professor's side. Do not be this person (it damages your reputation) and do not give any indication that you might be.

获得真实的现实世界经验，参与真正的代码库、项目或枯燥课程练习之外的问题，这是极其重要的。了解你并能为你写一封好的推荐信、证明你有主动性、热情和动力的教授或熟人极其重要。你在考虑找工作吗？去找暑期实习。你在考虑读研吗？去积累研究经验！报名参加学校提供的任何项目。或者联系教授/研究生，请求参与一个你喜欢的研究项目。如果他们认为你有足够的动力和积极性，这可能会奏效。不要低估这一点的重要性：一位知名的教授在推荐信中写道你是一个有动力、积极进取且有独立思考能力的人，这完全盖过了其他任何东西，尤其是像成绩这种琐碎的事情。在申请前争取发表至少一篇论文也会大有帮助。此外，你应该意识到，他们最头疼的是那些过度兴奋的本科生，他们报名参加了项目，见了几次面，问了很多问题，然后在研究生或教授投入了大量时间之后突然决定放弃并消失。不要做这种人（这会损害你的声誉），也不要表现出任何你可能是这种人的迹象。

---

Other than research projects, get involved with some group of people on side projects or better, start your own from scratch. Contribute to Open Source, make/improve a library. Get out there and create (or help create) something cool. Document it well. Blog about it. These are the things people will care about a few years down the road. Your grades? They are an annoyance you have to deal with along the way. Use your time well and good luck.

除了研究项目，和一群人一起参与业余项目，或者更好的是，从零开始开启你自己的项目。为开源做贡献，制作或改进一个库。走出去，创造（或帮助创造）一些酷的东西。做好文档记录。在博客上记录。这些才是人们在几年后会在意的事情。你的成绩？它们只是你沿途必须处理的一个小麻烦。好好利用你的时间，祝好运。
